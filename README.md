# Explainable-Machine-Learning-for-Cyberattack-Indentification-from-Traffic-Flows

This repository is used as a storage space for files pertaining to performing traffic simulations and recording the data through SUMO for the paper 	_Explainable Machine Learning for Cyberattack Identification from Traffic Flows_, published in May 2025 at the 46th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.
Located here is a folder containing the utilized SumoCFG file detailing the local area of Daytona Beach from OpenStreetMap, as well as additional configuration files added to track data in affected intersections and pathing logic. This folder must be referenced to reproduce the simulation settings. 
Additionally, this contains the .ipynb file that is used to run the simulation, utilizing the SUMO library TraCI included in the software download as well as the aforementioned folder. To reproduce proper Daytona Beach traffic settings, a traffic slider of 3.5 should be used after the software opens up. 

Portions of the project using explainable AI (XAI) machine learning techniques to determine if the network is compromised is located at the repository located here:
